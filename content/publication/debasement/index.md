abstract: "This chapter focuses on debasement language in contemporary Brazilian political communication, analyzing Jair Bolsonaro’s YouTube livestreams from 2019 to 2020. We understand debasement language as a discourse aiming to demean, degrade, or discredit a specific target, such as individuals, social groups, and personnel within political institutions. To assess and measure debasement language in Bolsonaro’s livestreams, we apply content analysis that codes its elements. Findings indicate that debasement discourse is essential to his messages throughout 2019 and 2020. Bolsonaro’s derogatory language addresses two main targets: left-wingers and the media. Using name-calling and insulting language, Bolsonaro attacks political parties, politicians, outlet groups, and journalists, among other subjects. Bolsonaro’s interactions (often with the Brazilian press and mainstream media) are also subject to misinformation. While the topics of his interactions with the media vary, he usually attacks media groups and journalists when he disagrees with something they published or said, especially when he is the target of criticism."
