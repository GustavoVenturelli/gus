abstract: "The lack of confidence in elections can undermine support for democracy, reduce vote turnout, and drive support for extreme candidates. This study uses data from the 2018 and 2022 Brazilian Electoral Study (BES) to investigate who distrusts elections in Brazil. We hypothesize that electoral losers, right-leaning individuals, internet-informed voters, and those with lower political sophistication are more likely to distrust elections. Probit maximum likelihood estimators confirm that losers, right-wingers, online-informed individuals, and those with low political interest are more prone to electoral distrust."
