abstract: "What is Bolsonaro’s effect on Brazilian democratic backsliding? What if he was not elected? This chapter uses the synthetic control method to show that despite being a symptom and continuer of Brazilian democratic erosion, Bolsonaro is not the baseline of the episode. Dilma Rousseff’s impeachment has a previous and greater causal effect in undermining democratic institutions in the country, proving that when misused, impeach- ment can harm democracy."
